    <description>Dazed with a bad headache, you awake to find yourself tied to a chair by the south wall of a concrete basement. Thanks to the light creeping in from a small, half-window on the west side of the room, you can make out a collection of tools on the east wall, and a staircase to the north. Perhaps you could try using one of those tools to free yourself...</description>
